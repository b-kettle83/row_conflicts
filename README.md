Conflicted? I was conflicted once. They put me in a repository. A conflicted repository. Conflicted?

Why is Sam so addicted to crunchy bars? Perhaps do they include methamphetamine? Or perhaps another substance that triggers the receptors in our brain, causing a desperate need for more? One can draw a parallel between the behaviour of Samie when it comes to crunchy bars, and the behaviour of a man yearning for his next fix of his favourite substance. Both are desperate for their manufactured and self created needs, something that could have been entirely avoided if they had simply abstained from their initial exposure to such a precarious habit. But now, both are entrapped in their desires and needs for what was once a simple commodoty, become adiction.
